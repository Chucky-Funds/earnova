🔒 WHY THIS IS SMART

✔ Videos stay rare
✔ Surveys & socials increase more
✔ High levels unlock more content
✔ Feels rewarding
✔ But daily caps still control earning

Even if Level 15 has:
6 videos

User can still only do:
3 per day.

So money stays controlled.




i want to add this full feature '
Daily Limit by Level:

Each user can only watch a certain number of videos per day (e.g., Level 1 = 1 video/day).
After Watching Daily Limit:

Once you reach your daily video limit, all video tasks are disabled (you cannot watch any more videos that day).
Daily Reset Timer:

There is a countdown timer. When it finishes (the next day starts), your daily video limit resets.
Replacing Watched Videos:

After the timer resets, the videos you already watched are removed from your list.
New, unwatched videos are loaded to replace them, so you always see a fresh set of videos you haven’t watched before.
Continuous Process:

This cycle repeats:
Watch up to your daily limit
Wait for the timer
Watched videos are replaced with new ones
Repeat
'
okay this part is already working right

After the timer resets, the videos tasks are enabled again and the videos you already watched are removed from your list.
