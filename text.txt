🔒 WHY THIS IS SMART

✔ Videos stay rare
✔ Surveys & socials increase more
✔ High levels unlock more content
✔ Feels rewarding
✔ But daily caps still control earning

Even if Level 15 has:
6 videos

User can still only do:
3 per day.

So money stays controlled.




i want to add this full feature to my survey profile dashboard question tab section'
Daily Limit by Level:

Each user can only answer a certain number of questions per day (e.g., Level 1 = 1 question/day).
After Watching Daily Limit:

Once you reach your daily video limit, all question tasks are disabled (you cannot answer any more questions that day).
Daily Reset Timer:

There is a countdown timer in the header. When it finishes (the next day starts), your daily question limit resets.
Replacing answered questions:

After the timer resets, the questions you already answered are removed from your list.
New, unanswered questions are loaded to replace them, so you always see a fresh set of questions you haven't answered before.
Continuous Process:

This cycle repeats:
Watch up to your daily limit
Wait for the timer
answered questions are replaced with new ones
Repeat
'

okay this part is already working right

please apply this feature the video tab has this type of feature but we dont need to touch the video tab this is only funtionality for the question tab there is no redesigning of any element here except for disabling and enabling no feature already ther i smeant to be deleted just add this feature and give me back may full updated profile.html and scripts.js code to copy. remember this is only functionality there is no designing here add the feature and give me back may full updated profile.html and scripts.js code to copy




Important:
You are only responsible for assigning the price and XP for website tasks on the task card.

You must not change anything else—no HTML, layout, text, buttons, images, or other design.
Do not change any other data.

Only price and XP fields should be modified.
This is your sole responsibility. Nothing else should be touched.

1️⃣ Categorize Website Tasks by Time Spent

Website tasks fall into five categories based on how long the user stays on the site.

You must assign the correct category before calculating the price and XP.

Category	Time Spent	Price Range (₦)	XP Range
Very Small	5 – 30s	1 – 3	1 – 3
Small	30 – 120s	3 – 8	3 – 8
Medium	120 – 600s	8 – 25	8 – 20
Large	600 – 1800s	25 – 60	20 – 40
Very Large	1800 – 3000s	60 – 100	40 – 60
Notes:

Duration is measured in seconds.

Every website task must have a unique price and XP, even if two tasks have the same duration.

Price and XP increase as the time increases.

You must add small random variation to make values unique.

2️⃣ Calculate Relative Duration Within Category

You must calculate how far the task duration is inside its category.

This is called:

duration_percent = (task_time - min_category_time) 
                   / (max_category_time - min_category_time)


This produces a value between 0 and 1.

Example

Task time = 900 seconds
Category = Large (600 – 1800s)

(900 – 600) / (1800 – 600)
= 300 / 1200
= 0.25


This means the task is 25% into the Large category.

3️⃣ Calculate Base Price and XP

Use linear interpolation:

price = min_price + duration_percent * (max_price - min_price)

XP = min_XP + duration_percent * (max_XP - min_XP)

Example (Large Task, 900s)

Large price range: 25 – 60 ₦
Large XP range: 20 – 40

duration_percent = 0.25

price = 25 + 0.25 * (60 - 25)
= 25 + 8.75
= 33.75 ₦

XP = 20 + 0.25 * (40 - 20)
= 20 + 5
= 25 XP

4️⃣ Add Small Random Variation

To prevent duplicate values:

price = price + random(-1, 1)
XP = XP + random(-0.5, 0.5)


Rules:

Price variation: ±1 ₦

XP variation: ±0.5

Final values must remain inside the category range.

5️⃣ Ensure Uniqueness

Even after randomization:

No two website tasks may have the exact same price and XP.

Decimal differences are required if durations are similar.

Uniqueness must be enforced across the entire system.

6️⃣ Ensure Proportionality

The system must reward longer website sessions more than shorter ones.

Longer time → higher price

Longer time → higher XP

Random variation must not break this rule.

7️⃣ Price and XP Must Reflect Duration Exactly

Do NOT assign flat values.

You must:

Determine the category

Calculate duration_percent

Interpolate price and XP

Apply small random variation

Round to 1 decimal place if needed

Ensure uniqueness

Examples

5s → Very Small → near minimum price & XP
60s → Small → mid Small range
300s → Medium → mid Medium range
2000s → Very Large → high end of system

Every task must be different.

8️⃣ Constraints for the AI

Never touch HTML, layout, images, buttons, or text.

Only modify numeric fields: price and XP.

Always stay within category ranges.

Apply variation carefully.

Ensure uniqueness.

Maintain proportionality.

Decimals are allowed.

Do not hardcode fixed values.

All calculations must be dynamic.

9️⃣ Debugging Guide (Internal Logic)

If task_time < 30s → Very Small
If 30s ≤ task_time < 120s → Small
If 120s ≤ task_time < 600s → Medium
If 600s ≤ task_time < 1800s → Large
If 1800s ≤ task_time ≤ 3000s → Very Large

Base price = min_price + duration_percent * (max_price - min_price)
Base XP = min_XP + duration_percent * (max_XP - min_XP)


Randomize:

±1 ₦ price

±0.5 XP

Ensure final values:

Within range

Unique

Proportional

🔟 End Rules (Do Not Break)

You only touch numeric fields: price and XP.
Everything else remains unchanged.
All website tasks must be processed.
All ranges must be respected.
Random variation must be applied carefully.
Values must be proportional to time spent.
Values must be unique across all website tasks. the none of the webssite price should exceed 100 and none of the webstie card xp must exceed 60

There is in the profile tab, that is in the profile navigation system, navigation place in the profile tab, you can see that there is a section, there is a section for upgrading to other levels. There is a section down, down for upgrading to other levels. So my rule was that if you want to move to the next level, you have to pay a sum of 1,000. You have to pay the sum of 1,000. Now, you have to run your XP at a specific amount, you have to reach before you can go to the next level, 14 points. And if your XP reaches that amount and you want to move to the next level, you must pay 1,000 naira to move to the next level. And that is what I want. Now, I want you to implement this functionality. There is no design. We don't want to redesign, but you might use HTML, you might use CSS. There is no redesign in here. This is purely functionality. There is no redesign in here do not remove or do anything that will afetc existing functions. I'll just ask you that on my profile tab, here I have where you can change your personal details and then you can withdraw your money. You can also see down here they say you can change your levels. My plan is that I want that feature that when your XP reaches the amount for another level and you want to go to that next level, you will pay 1,000 naira through Paystack. I will give you the public key. You pay 1,000 naira through Paystack, which I will give you the public key. Once your payment has been verified and your XP has reached the issue that it is, you will now be able to move to the next level. and then after adding this functionality update my full  (full) code and give it back to me to copy . so first of just explain what i asked you to do 


to check pay to next level
// 2. Set XP to 600 (Level 2 requires 500 XP)
localStorage.setItem('earnova_xp', '600');

// 3. Reload the page to apply changes to the UI
location.reload();
